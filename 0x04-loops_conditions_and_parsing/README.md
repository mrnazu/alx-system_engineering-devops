# 0x04. Loops, Conditions and Parsing

Welcome to Loops, conditions, and parsing! In this project, you will be learning about some of the basic building blocks of shell scripting: loops, conditions, and file parsing. We'll start with a brief overview of each topic and then dive into some practical exercises. By the end of the project, you'll be able to write simple shell scripts that use loops, conditions, and file parsing to perform tasks.

Loops in shell scripting

Loops are a powerful tool in shell scripting that allow you to repeat a set of instructions a certain number of times. They can be used to automate repetitive tasks and save time and effort. There are two types of loops in shell scripting: the while loop and the for loop.

The while loop continues to execute a set of instructions as long as a certain condition is met. The syntax for a while loop is:

```bash
while condition do
  command1
  command2
  ...
done
```
The for loop is used to iterate over a list of values or a range of values. The syntax for a for loop is:

```css
for variable in value1 value2 ... valueN; do
    command1
    command2
    ...
done
```
To use shell loops, you need to understand variable assignment and arithmetic, comparison operators, and file test operators.

File parsing in shell scripting

File parsing is the process of extracting information from a file and processing it in some way. In shell scripting, you can use built-in utilities like cut, grep, and uniq to parse files.

Cut is a powerful utility that allows you to extract specific columns from a file. The syntax for the cut command is:

```bash
cut -f [field-number | field-specifier] [file-name] [options]
```
Where

* `-f` is the option to select specific fields from a file
* `field-number` selects a field by its number starting from 1
* `field-specifier` selects a field using a comma-separated list of field specifications

To parse files in shell scripting, you need to understand shell syntax, variables, arithmetic, and command substitution.
